# Virtual Scrum Master

We believe big differences can be created with small but "smart & effective" ideas. So we thought to create Virtual Scrum Master, a companion for every engineer working on IT projects. It will engage with them and help them easily log key & timely happenings, updates which can make big difference.

Proposed solution is to leverage human like conversational Chat-bots* to engage with engineers on the channels they visit the most, like, social messenger (Facebook). Combination of social channel & engaging chat-bot empowers team members with ease of access to scrum management tool and thus task status update is no more a problem as it can be done on the move. This will assure current project health can be monitored and risks can be mitigated in timely fashion. Chat-bot* is a smart software, which along with AI can connect with end users via "human like conversation".
